# News Flash API

This is the graphQL api for my Egghead course for building an offline-capable news app with React Native ans urql.

## Developer setup

To run this api locally, first clone the repo, then install the dependencies using your favourite package manager:

```sh
yarn
## or
npm install
```

Then run the api loally with

```sh
yarn start
```

This will start the api on `http://localhost:3000`.
