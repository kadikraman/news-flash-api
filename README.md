# News Flash API

This is the graphQL api for my Egghead course for building an offline-capable news app with React Native ans urql.

Note: this api is built for educational purposes only and is not suitable for production use. For the sake of simplicity, the bookmarks data is read and written to the file system in `data.json`.

## Developer setup

To run this api locally, first clone the repo, then install the dependencies using your favourite package manager:

```sh
yarn
## or
npm install
```

Then run the api loally with

```sh
yarn start
```

This will start the api on `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.
